                     <p>Human-sized tribal lizard. Although they may seem like stupid dinosaurs, Lizalfos are very skilled in weaponry and also display impressive agility. A lizalfos can jump right over our hero's head to strike him in the back if he is not careful.</p>

         <!--
            This is where I used the address element. I feel the footer is a valid place to put this since it often times contains contact information. I did not want to give away my home address so I thought it would make sense to put Nintendo's mailing address since they created the series. The address element does have its own styling, however I think that it is best suited for screen readers so that they can know to read the text as if it were a street address. I could see this being a real benefit for accesibilty.
