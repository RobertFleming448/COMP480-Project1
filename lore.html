               Several times in this project I used the align attribute in places where the "text-align" styling method wouldn't work. In order to get the audio element in the center of the page, where I wanted it, I needed to first wrap it in a <div> element. The div element supports the align attribute without changing the format of my page. With this method I was able to allign an element in the spot I wanted it without it having to be text. Later in this page I use it in a different method.

               <!-- While the autoplay function used here is set to inactive in most browsers by default I thought I will still include it to demonstrate my thought process. I wanted this music to automatically play as the website loaded. Although that may not be the best for user interface, it was me just trying to demonstrate my understanding. In order to make it play automatically on the page load I also made use of the preload attribute. This attribute makes it so the resource is loaded automatically as the page loaded. I included this so the user could get some related music while reading the related lore. Although this page will not be graded in Internet Explorer, I thought it worth mentioning that it allows the autoplay functionality for audio. However I use autoplay in another section of this project to make up for this somewhat broken functionality.

            <p>While The Legend of Zelda is a series that is mostly praised for its exploration, is also has a notable plot. Parts of the plot are revealed as the games continue. This page will function as a brief overview of some of the most notable aspects of the Zelda lore. Play the music above for a little extra ambience!</p>

            Note that in this section a combination of the flowright styling and the allign attributes are used. There is a reason for this. On the first point, I use the image to describe a general introduction to the concept. As a result the text is much longer than the details later. For this reason I wanted the text to wrap arounf the image to use space effectively. However on the details, I wanted each image to be in line with each other on the right. If I were to use the flowRight style, they would be placed immediatley adjacent to the text making them not alligned. To fix this I used the align attribute which aligned them to the right margin seperate from the text.

            <p>The Golden Triangles that The Golden Goddesses left behind when they entered the sacred realm. Any mortal who controls the Triforce has control over the power of creation itself, thus granting them any wish. However, in order to properly control the Triforce, its user must be perfectly balanced in all three aspects of the Goddesses: power, wisdom, courage. Should an unbalanced individual ever grasp the sacred relic, it will split into three with each piece seeking out the person that most represents its quality.</p>

            <p><img src="assets/lore/hylia.png" alt="The New Goddess Hylia" width=25% height=25% class="flowLeft"> Upon the Golden Goddess's exit, they entrusted the Triforce to the lesser Goddess Hylia. Hylia and her army of light fought the evil King of Demons, Demise and sealed him away. The Goddess Hylia, now feeling her work was done decided to <a href="characters.html#zelda" title="reincarnation">reincarnate as a mortal</a> to enjoy the new peace she had created.  </p>
            <p><img src="assets/lore/demise.png" alt="The Demon King" width=20% height=20% class="flowRight">  After some time, the seal weakened, and the horribly disfigured Demon king was revived. It was up to the Goddess' chosen Hero and her reincarnation to stop Demise the Demon King from taking over the world. In their quest, the Chosen Hero forged the Master Sword, a legendary blade that could defeat the Demon King forever. So, the Hero and the Demon King faced off one-on-one. Although a fierce battle, the Chosen Hero was victorious. With the Demon King's final breath, he placed a curse on the Chosen Hero and Goddess' bloodline. All future descendants would be cursed by an <a href="characters.html#ganon" title="Evil">Incarnation of Evil.</a></p>
            <p>This Incarnation of Evil would follow the bloodline of these characters for all time, and regardless of their efforts, peace would always eventually be broken by the Demon King's malice.</p>

            This is where I used the address element. I feel the footer is a valid place to put this since it often times contains contact information. I did not want to give away my home address so I thought it would make sense to put Nintendo's mailing address since they created the series. The address element does have its own styling, however I think that it is best suited for screen readers so that they can know to read the text as if it were a street address. I could see this being a real benefit for accesibilty.
